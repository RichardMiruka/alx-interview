The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. Backtracking Algorithms

* Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
* [Backtracking Introduction](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/LLnF6u2i3A_xIwDjJsP8zQ)

### 2. Recursion

* Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
* [Recursion in Python](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/X1vaNXgy_pPyvKfOJm90XQ)

### 3. List Manipulations in Python

* Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
* [Python Lists](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/P3KbYxmdtSeoJvVfr9Iv0w)

### 4. Python Command Line Arguments

* Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
* [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/2IF4V6xsY_Nq-xcGDK3Bhw)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.
