# Question

There are n players standing in one row, one player on a field. they are numbed from 0-n from left to right. layers perform moves one by one from left to right, that is, in ascending order of numbers. Each player presses an arrow key in one of the four cardinal directions: left<, right >, up ^ or down v. A key press in the given directions means the player attempts to move onto the closest field in the direction specified. A move can be performed only if there is no other player already standing on the target file. Moves are represented as a string S of length N, where S(K) (for K within the range 0..N-1) is in the direction of the K-th player's move. How many players will actually move successfully? Write a function def solution(S) which given a string S of length N representing the arrow keys pressed by each of the players, returns the number of players that will perform a move successfully. Assume that N is an integer within the range [1..50]: string S is made only of the following characters '^', 'v', '<' and/or '>'.
