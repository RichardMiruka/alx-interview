# To solve this problem, we can simulate the movements of the players based on the given directions in the string S.
# We can keep track of the positions of the players and update them according to the direction specified. 
# If a player attempts to move to a position where another player is already standing, that move is not successful.

        # Update the position of the player based on the movement command
        if move == '^':
            current_pos -= 1 # Move the player up one step
